# python_unix_emulator
Python program that is capable of creating a virtual namespace through simulated Unix commands.

# High Level Capabilities
- Interpret commands received on standard input.
- Produce messages on standard output.
- Maintain some data structure that keeps track of a virtual name space.
- Create, delete and move virtual files and folders during program run time.
- Support user and permission management in addition to file management.

# Commands
## exit
- Quit the program.

## pwd
- Print the name of current working virtual directory.

## cd <dir>
- Change the working directory to <dir>.
- Require current effective user's execute bit x on <dir> and on <dir>'s ancestors.

## mkdir [-p] <dir>
- Create the directory <dir> if doesn't exist.
- Require current effecetive user's execute bit x on <dir>'s ancestors.
- Require current effective user's write bit w on <dir>'s parent.
- Directories are created with drwxr-x permission with regards to the current effective user.

## touch <file>
- Create the file <file> if doesn't exist.
- Require current effective user's execute bit x on <file>'s ancestors.
- Require current effective user's write bit w on <file>'s parent.
- Files are created with -rw-r-- permission with regards to the current effective user.

## cp <src> <dst>
- Copy a file <src> to a file <dst>
- Require current effective user's read bit r on <src>.
- Require current effective user's execute bit x on <src>'s and <dst>'s ancestors.
- Require current effective user's write bit w on <dst>'s parent.

## mv <src> <dst>
- Move a file <src> to a file <dst>.
- Require current effective user's execute bit x on <src>'s and <dst>'s ancestors.
- Require current effective user's write bit w on <src>'s and <dst>'s parent.

## rm <path>
- Remove the file at <path>
- Require current effective user's write bit w on <path>.
- Require current effective user's execute bit x on <path>'s ancestors.
- Require current effective user's write bit w on <path>'s parent.

## rmdir <dir>
- Remove empty directory
- Require current effective user's exceute bit x on <dir>'s ancestors.
- Require current effectuve user's write bit w on <dir>'s parent.

## chmod [-r] <s> <path>
- Change file mode bits
- Require current effective user to be either the owner of <path> or root.
- Require current effective user's execute bit x of <path>'s ancestors.
- If the current effective user is nether the owner of <path> nor root, operation is not permitted.
- -r changes mode of files and directories at <path> recursively.

## chown [-r] <user> <path>
- Change file owner.
- Only allowed by root.

## adduser <user>
- Add a user to the system.
- Only allowed by root.

## deluser <user>
- Remove a user from the system.
- Only allowed by root.

## su [user]
- Switch the current effective user to <user>
- Switch to root if <user> omitted.

## ls [-a] [-d] [-l] [path]
- List information about <path>. Sort entries alphabetically.
- Require current effective user's read bit r on <path>.
- Require current effective ucer's read bit r on <path>'s parent if <path> is a valid file or -d is specified.
- Require current effective user's execute bit x on <path>'s ancestors.

# A Note on Errors
- The program will never crash as all invalid inputs are accounted for.
- For any invalid inputs (e.g. invalid commands, referring to non-existent files/directories/users operations trying to be done without necessary permissions) an appropriate error message will be displayed.
